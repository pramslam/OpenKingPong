# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, come find us in EugeneTech Slack #king-pong-plan. We want you working on things you're excited about.

Here are some important resources:

  * Our Roadmap. Ultimately we want King Pong to be available for anyone to build, anywhere in the world.
  * The Project tab is used for our day-to-day project management space.
  * Bugs? Make an issue!
  * EugeneTech Slack: #king-pong-plan. We are usually there during business hours.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to OpenKingPong](https://github.com/pramslam/OpenKingPong/pull/new/master).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Thanks,
David Lo
